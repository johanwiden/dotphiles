# The current version of exwm (0.23) uses only one X11 display. All X11 screens (what xrandr calls "output") are attached
# to that display, so X11 considers all screens to have the same Dots-Per-Inch (DPI).
# "xrandr --dpi" sets DPI for an X11 display, not for just a screen.
# "xrandr --fbmm" is also per display, not for just a screen.
# This implies that if we want a certain font size to have similar physical size on each screen, then we need to
# set the xrandr --mode on each screen to a similar physical DPI.
# I have two monitors, one that can achieve a physical DPI of up to 246 (call that HiDPI),
# and one that can achieve a physical DPI of up to 106.
# So in case I want say emacs default font to display similarly on both monitors, then I have to set a low resolution mode
# on the screen attached to the HiDPI monitor.

# X11 screens (xrandr graphics outputs) I want to use. Names and values are from the output of /usr/bin/xrandr
# They can be ordered in any way you want. The leftmost available screen will be primary, unless overridden
# by X11_SCREEN_PREFERRED and that screen is available.
# The primary screen is the default screen used for EXWM workspaces.
# It will also be sorted first in Xinerama and RANDR geometry requests.
